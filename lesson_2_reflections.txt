2.5 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory gets created. It is needed because the history of commits gets saved in that directory.


2.8 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It prevents wasting to much memory space by getting a copy of every file.
Instead it just makes a copy of files that actually changed.
Though you would get this functionality too, if you would automaticlly run git diff on all files
and then just add the changed files to the staging area.
The only very small gain i see from having it to do manually is,
that you if you implemented to distinctive features and forgot to commit after the 1. one you still
can make 2 seperate commits, 1 for each feature.
